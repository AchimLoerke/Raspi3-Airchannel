# Raspi3-Airchannel
3D printed air channel for the Raspberry Pi 3B+

This model is intended to be used with a 60mm fan. I used a Noctua NF-A6x25 which comes with rubber connectors. In order to connect the fan to the GPIO of the Raspberry Pi use a 5V version.

The model features an airchannel on the upper and lower sides of the raspberry pi. So you may add Heatsinks to the SOC and the memory chip at the bottom. I also used a small heatsink on the casing of the SD and one on the USB controller. But these seem to be not really necessary.

Please rotate the top part 180Â° before printing. Both parts print well on FDM printers without support.
